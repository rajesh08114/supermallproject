<h1>Super Mall Web Application - Manage Shopâ€™s Offer, Products & Location</h1>
<h3>About the project </h3>
<p> A SuperMall Web app is a website that allows merchants to advertise and sell their products at developing counters. Rural towns would be able to sell their commodities to the rest of the globe as a result of this. The goal of this project is to establish a portal that allows consumers to securely update product information using a mobile device while also allowing them to purchase goods from the merchant. The user's primary concern is to discover their talents and to improve our commercial business's ability to reach out to customers. In the future, the internet will become the heart and soul of the business world; all trades will be conducted through it, therefore this gateway may be beneficial to the user as a business.
